Personal Project Deep Dive

## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work. I see that a key point that sets you apart is your focus on values. I look forward to seeing how you choose to highlight this point in your project. Your Use Case does a great job outlining your Persona's goals, but could use a little more detail regarding the technology used. Overall, great work - your Purpose, Audience, Goals, and Persona are all well done. Your directory structure is perfect. There are a few very minor errors in your code - see Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

As of now, your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Make the corrections listed below and add some additional detail to your Use Case by the due date and I'll bump the grade to [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Update 07/19/16
Your PWP Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice work. We will cover Milestone 2 UX Design material on Wednesday or Thursday this week.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Remember to commit early and often. I noticed the source code on your deployment and the code in your last GitHub commit is very slightly different. Are all your latest changes committed and pushed? 
- In your .gitignore: DS_Store is missing the preceding "."
- On line 50 - the closing &lt;/h2&gt; tag is missing a closing "&gt;"
- Be careful with your indentation, as it is slightly off.
