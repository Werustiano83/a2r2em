Personal Project Deep Dive

## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work. I see that a key point that sets you apart is your focus on values. I look forward to seeing how you choose to highlight this point in your project. Your Use Case does a great job outlining your Persona's goals, but could use a little more detail regarding the technology used. Overall, great work - your Purpose, Audience, Goals, and Persona are all well done. Your directory structure is perfect. There are a few very minor errors in your code - see Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

As of now, your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Make the corrections listed below and add some additional detail to your Use Case by the due date and I'll bump the grade to [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Update 07/19/16
Your PWP Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice work. We will cover Milestone 2 UX Design material on Wednesday or Thursday this week.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Remember to commit early and often. I noticed the source code on your deployment and the code in your last GitHub commit is very slightly different. Are all your latest changes committed and pushed? 
- In your .gitignore: DS_Store is missing the preceding "."
- On line 50 - the closing &lt;/h2&gt; tag is missing a closing "&gt;"
- Be careful with your indentation, as it is slightly off.

Beautiful wireframes here. You've put a lot of thought into your layout and content organization, and this will serve you well as a guide for your front-end development. For the Blog page, insert static content for the PWP for now. Installing/integrating a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) managed blog into that page down the line should not be difficult at all. Unfortunately, that kind of feature generally falls outside of PWP scope as it involves setting up a database and usually a custom theme - but if you get there, talk to us!

**Sitemap**: Items 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, and 5.1 can be removed as they refer to content items, not individual pages. Very nice work on your sitemap presentation.

**Wireframe**: On your content pages, (About, Portfolio, Blog, Contact), do you plan to feature the same top navigation as on the Home page? I think the default Bootstrap navbar with your own custom styling might be an easy-to-implement navigation solution. Also, just consider the sizes and proportions of your logo and company name. They look a little large on the wireframe in proportion to your content and screen size, but if it works design-wise go for it. 

If you are light on content, you might consider placing the Contact form and the About content on the same page. If content is lengthy, then keep them separate. [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) can be used for your social media icons.

It looks like you have two different footer formats: one for large screens and one for mobile. FYI - when you get there in your development, Bootstrap has built-in [responsive utility classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities) that can help you load one footer on small screens, and another on large screens. 

Very nice work here - we still have yet to cover CSS and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) in class, but you can use the extra time to further refine your design choices and create your page content.
Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

- Don't forget the `alt` attribute on your images.
