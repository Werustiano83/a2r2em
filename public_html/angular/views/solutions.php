		<p>We want our work to have a positive impact in communities. Local business growing, non-profits helping more people, the person with the next great product or idea should be helped by software as much as possible. All of that with the only purpose of creating a world where we all can thrive.</p>

				<p>Roots-n-table is a virtual farmers market. In collaboration with other developers we built a communication tool that helps farmers and growers get in touch with their neighbors and sell their products in their communities. Roots-n-table also allows everybody to purchase products grown and made by local people.</p>
