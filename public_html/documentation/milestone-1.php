				<h2> Persona </h2>
					<p><strong>Name:</strong> William Goodman (Mr. GoodWill)</p>
					<p><strong>Age:</strong> Millenial cohort</p>
					<p><strong>Ocupation:</strong> Mr. GoodWill is the founder of a nonprofit called "Homeless Empowerment", which provides a lot of services to homeless persons.

					<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Mr. GoodWill, is a Windows 8 user. Since he attends a lot of meetings during the day, he has an HP Pavillion Lap Top with a 15.6 screen, and a Surface Pro 3 tablet. He carries both and uses the Surface during meetings to take notes and the Lap Top to perform other aspects of their aspect.</p>
					<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> William is very busy looking for money. That is his main priority and the survival of his non-profit is essencial for any other project to take place. He attends a lot of meeting in order to fulfill such purpose and has very little time for all the other items in his calendar. He will do research in Linkedin and will dedicate about a minute looking at web developers portfolio in order to make a choice about who to contact. He's not in a hurry, but the sooner he can make his website happen the better.</p>
					<p><strong>Frustrations and needs:</strong> William will need to contract a company that understands his project  very well, he knows there's a lot of wordpress "experts" and developers out there that can do a great job, but he wants a real commitment from the developers towards the project. Which means they will understand the values behind it and will have a greater level of commitment than anybody else. Nevertheless, he has set aside a sufficient budget to cover this expenses and is willing to reward properly to the chosen company.</p>
					<p><strong>Goal:</strong>William will do a lot of reseach through the linkedin website, but he won't make a lot of calls. He has decided to make only 5 calls after he's finished researching based on the portfolio of the developers and whatever information he can find in their website. Such calls will be only 3 minute long and he will only get answers to his specific questions.</p>
